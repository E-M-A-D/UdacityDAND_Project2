## Investigate a Dataset

This project is about investigating the Titanic dataset provided by Kaggle. The dataset contains information about the Titanic passengers, such as their age, survival and family members on board.

The investigation was done over an iPython notebook, using with Pandas and matplotlib among other things. The investigation is mainly done through graphs, and then a hypothesis testing about if the survival chance is affected by being accompanied by family members on board. At the end, there was a quick try of associating different family members together, grouped by how the family survived during the tragic event.

This project was submitted to Udacity's Data Analyst NanoDegree.
